<font size="3"> In the past years, I had different teaching experiences, for different audiences and with different methodologies. 

* In 2010, I worked as a part-time high school teacher at [Gustavo Gonzaga School](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Escola-B%C3%A1sica-Prof-Gustavo-Augusto-Gonzaga/196206913741888). I was responsible for the Physics classes for all students at the high school. That was my first time as a teacher, and I could learn a lot, from both my colleagues and the students.  

* In 2019 I worked as a Professor in [UniSociesc](https://www.unisociesc.com.br/). I lectured Physics for students of Mechanical, Electrical and Civil Engineering.  

* In 2019 I also worked as an online tutor in [Catolica de Santa Catarina](http://www.catolicasc.org.br/). I was responsible for giving help and feedback for students in different subjects, like Mathematics, Physics, Calculus and Algebra. It was a different experience for someone coming from the traditional blackboard classes, and the new technologies broadened my vision of the many ways we can teach and learn. The fast-paced environment and the colleagues were amazing, and I just left it because I got a postdoctoral fellowship.
