## Teaching experience  
<br>  
<font size="3"> In the past years, I could had different experiences working as a high school teacher and after as a university professor.  

I worked in 2010 as a high school teacher, responsible for the Physics classes.  

In 2019 I worked as an on-line tutor in a college. I was responsible for give help and feedback for students in different subjects, as Mathematics, Physics, Calculus and Algebra.  

Also in 2019 I worked as a Professor in a private university, with Physics lectures to engineering students. </font>
