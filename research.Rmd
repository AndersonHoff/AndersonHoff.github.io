<font size="3"> My research contributions are related to the steps in my career in the fields of photovoltaic devices, chaotic dynamic systems and electronic circuit analysis. In every work, I have optimized the existing model and published articles in relevant journals. Nowadays, I have been working on the connection between these fields, which can be a unique opportunity considering my experience in each particular research.

### Postdoctoral Research

<font size="3"> In my postdoctoral research, I worked with time series analysis with Prof. Holokx A. Albuquerque. However, different from my master's research, at this time we built analogic electronic circuits to study the chaotic behavior of systems under different parameters, and correlated the results with numerical simulations. 

For the first time, we applied the 0-1 Test for Chaos to characterize the behavior of electronic systems in the parameter-space of dynamical systems, identifying the pattern behaviour by its time series analysis. The first results are published on International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos. To achieve it, I developed programming routines in R to automate the numerical procedure for big datasets, which are being applied by other students from the research group in their analyses of numerical and experimental chaotic systems. These routines are available in my GitHub account and its functionality meets the demands of the academic community.

Some interesting results are still to be published. Other results were published and are listed below.

### Ph.D. in Physics  

<font size="3"> In my Ph.D. research, I worked in the Group of Organic Optoelectronic Devices, under supervision of [Prof. Ivo A. Hümmelgem](http://fisica.ufpr.br/pagina_ppgf_english/info_ivo.html). This was an experimental research with organic and inorganic solar cells. I worked with development and characterization of thin films and devices. This work was a mix between theory and experimental. The results are published in the following papers:

<i class="fa fa-file"></i> [Morphological, optical and electrical properties of GaSe9 films and its application in photovoltaic devices](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10854-016-5794-5)

I have contributed to the research on solar cells and particularly in the application of Selenium and Selenium-based alloys in photovoltaic devices, highlighting the effects of adding different materials to the morphological and optical characteristics of Selenium in the fabrication of thin films. The obtained results explained the functionality of a simple structure, and how the film morphology and charge transfer to the electrodes is modified in a way that its power output is improved in consequence of the gallium. For the first time, careful analyses of capacitance-voltage and impedance spectroscopy were performed for Selenium-based solar cells, and I identified the recombination process that limits its efficiency and possible ways to overcome it. I published the results in two articles at Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, a relevant and high-impact journal in the field of solar energy research.

### Master in Physics  

<font size="3"> In my MS research, I worked under supervision of [Prof. Holokx A. Albuquerque](https://www.udesc.br/professor/holokx.albuquerque). My research was related to chaos theory and time series analysis. Particularly, I worked with bifurcation curves and Lyapunov exponents in chaotic dynamical systems. The following papers resulted from these researchs:  

<i class="fa fa-file"></i> [Bifurcation structures and transient chaos in a four-dimensional Chua model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960113010384)

The European Physical Journal B - 2014  

<i class="fa fa-file"></i> [Extensive numerical study and circuitry implementation of the Watt governor model](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218127417501759)  
International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos - 2017 </font> 

My research on my Master’s and more recently on my postdoctoral level contributed to the understanding of the chaotic behaviour on electronic systems, from both numerical and experimental approaches. Besides, the employment of different tools gave detailed information regarding the connection between different analyses and how to combine them in parameter-spaces, with results published in relevant journals as International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, Physics Letters A and The European Physics Journal B.
