 <font size="3"> I love Physics, Mathematics, Statistics, Chemistry, and how we can use this knowledge to understand and explain almost every behavior in few lines. Also, I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I work with different sources to improve my R programming and analysis skills. Also, I am working with Tableau in some data analysis projects.   

To have a big picture about my qualifications, take a look of my resume available [here](files/AndersonHoff_resume.pdf).  

In some words, I graduated from the [Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina](https://www.udesc.br/cct/ppgf) with a BS and after a MS in Physics in 2014. In this same year I began working toward my PhD in Physics as a full-time research assistant at [Universidade Federal do Parana](http://fisica.ufpr.br/pagina_ppgf_english/), where I built and fully characterized organic and inorganic solar cells, under the advisement of [Dr. Ivo A. HÃ¼mmelgen](http://fisica.ufpr.br/pagina_ppgf_english/info_ivo.html). I obtained my PhD in the end of 2017.

In 2018 I started a postdoctorate at [Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina](https://www.udesc.br/cct/ppgf), with a research in chaotic time series in the laboratory of [Porf. Holokx A. Albuquerque](https://www.udesc.br/professor/holokx.albuquerque). That turned on as an incredible opportunity to use my laboratory skills and master my programming skills, and could learn more about R and Python. At this time I started using R, and I am now an R enthusiast.   

In the beggining of 2020 I moved from Brazil to Canada, and now I am based in London ON. </font>
