 <font size="3"> I love Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, and to research and connect pieces of information to develop new products and solutions for a cleaner and more efficient world. Besides, I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Nowadays I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Calgary, working at the Functional Materials and Advanced Coatings Laboratory with organic solar cells (OPVs) and leds (OLEDs), part of the [Welch Research Group](https://welchlab.wixsite.com/website) of [Prof. Gregory Welch](https://science.ucalgary.ca/chemistry/contacts/gregory).  

In some words, I graduated from the [Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina](https://www.udesc.br/cct/ppgf) with a BS and after an MS in Physics in 2014. In this same year, I began working toward my Ph.D. in Physics as a full-time research assistant at [Universidade Federal do Parana](http://fisica.ufpr.br/pagina_ppgf_english/), where I built and fully characterized organic and inorganic solar cells, under the advisement of [Prof. Ivo A. HÃ¼mmelgen](http://fisica.ufpr.br/pagina_ppgf_english/info_ivo.html). I obtained my Ph.D. at the end of 2017.

From 2018 to 2019 I worked as a Physics and Mathematics Lecturer, and after as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the laboratory of [Prof. Holokx A. Albuquerque](https://www.udesc.br/professor/holokx.albuquerque), from the [Physics Department](https://www.udesc.br/cct/departamentos/fisica) of the [Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina](https://www.udesc.br/international). My research was focused on chaotic time series analysis, obtained by electronic circuits and numerical simulations. 
                                                                                                                                            
At the beginning of 2020, I moved from Brazil to Canada, and now I am based in Calgary, the sunniest city of Canada and besides the amazing Rocky Mountains. </font>
