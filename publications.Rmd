<font size="3"> During my academic journey, I have published papers in different scientific peer-reviewed journals, in a variety of fields, always related with my scientific research at the time. The complete list can also be seen in [Google Sholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oV62NPgAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR).

These papers are listed below, where I separated according to the respective research. </font>

### Postdoctoral Research

<font size="3"> In my postdoctoral research, I worked with time series analysis with Prof. Holokx A. Albuquerque. However, different from my master's research, at this time we built analogic electronic circuits to study the chaotic behavior of systems under different parameters, and correlated the results with numerical simulations. Some interesting results are still to be published. Other results were published and are listed below.

The European Physical Journal B - 2019  

<i class="fa fa-file"></i> [Characterizing the Dynamics of the Watt Governor System Under Harmonic Perturbation and Gaussian Noise](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218127420300013)  
International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos - 2020  

Particularly, the last publication is a Featured Article, and the cover of [International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos 30-01](https://www.worldscientific.com/toc/ijbc/30/01), which I share below. </font>

### Ph.D. in Physics  

<font size="3"> In my Ph.D. research, I worked in the Group of Organic Optoelectronic Devices, under supervision of [Prof. Ivo A. Hümmelgem](http://fisica.ufpr.br/pagina_ppgf_english/info_ivo.html). This was an experimental research with organic and inorganic solar cells. I worked with development and characterization of thin films and devices. This work was a mix between theory and experimental. The results are published in the following papers:

<i class="fa fa-file"></i> [Morphological, optical and electrical properties of GaSe9 films and its application in photovoltaic devices](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10854-016-5794-5)

### Master in Physics  

<font size="3"> In my MS research, I worked under supervision of [Prof. Holokx A. Albuquerque](https://www.udesc.br/professor/holokx.albuquerque). My research was related to chaos theory and time series analysis. Particularly, I worked with bifurcation curves and Lyapunov exponents in chaotic dynamical systems. The following papers resulted from these researchs:  

<i class="fa fa-file"></i> [Bifurcation structures and transient chaos in a four-dimensional Chua model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960113010384)
