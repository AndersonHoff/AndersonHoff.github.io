## Research and publications  

<font size="3"> During my academic journey, I have published papers in different journals, in a variety of fields, always related with my scientific research. The complete list can also be seen in [Google Sholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oV62NPgAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR).

These papers are listed below, where I separated according to the respective research. </font>  
  
### Master in Physics  

<font size="3"> In my MS research, I worked under supervision of [Dr. Holokx A. Albuquerque](https://www.udesc.br/professor/holokx.albuquerque). My research was related to chaos theory and time series analysis. Particularly, I worked with bifurcation curves and Lyapunov exponents in chaotic dynamical systems. The following papers resulted from these researchs:  

[Bifurcation structures and transient chaos in a four-dimensional Chua model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375960113010384)  
Physics Letters A - 2014  

[Numerical bifurcation analysis of two coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjb/e2014-50170-9)  
The European Physical Journal B - 2014  

[Extensive numerical study and circuitry implementation of the Watt governor model](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218127417501759)  
International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos - 2017 </font> 

### PhD in Physics  

<font size="3"> In my PhD research, on the other hand, I worked in the Group of Organic Optoelectronic Devices, under supervision of [Dr. Ivo A. Hümmelgem](http://fisica.ufpr.br/pagina_ppgf_english/info_ivo.html). This was an experimental research with organic and inorganic solar cells. I worked with development and characterization of thin films and devices. This work was a mix between theory and experimental. The results are published in the following papers:

[Morphological, optical and electrical properties of GaSe9 films and its application in photovoltaic devices](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10854-016-5794-5)  
Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics - 2017  

[Influence of an interfacial cesium oxide thin layer in the performance and internal dynamic processes of GaSe9 solar cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024817303215)  
Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells - 2017  

[Enhancement of P3HT organic photodiodes by the addition of a GaSe9 alloy thin layer ](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6641/aa74fe/meta)  
Semiconductor Science and Technology - 2017  
 
[GaxSe10-x based solar cells: Some alternatives for the improvement in their performance parameters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024819300029)  
Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells - 2019 </font> 

### Postdoctorate in Physics

<font size="3"> In my postdoctorate, I worked again with time series analysis with Dr. Holokx A. Albuquerque. But at this time we built analogic electronic circuits to study the chaotic behavior of the system under different parameters, and correlated the results with numerical simulations. Many interesting results are still waiting to be published. other results were published and are listed below.  

[Tracking multistability in the parameter space of a Chua’s circuit model](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjb/e2019-90749-x)  
The European Physical Journal B - 2019  

[Characterizing the Dynamics of the Watt Governor System Under Harmonic Perturbation and Gaussian Noise](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218127420300013)  
International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos - 2020  

Particularly, the last publication is a Featured Article, and the cover of the issue. This cover is presented below. </font>
