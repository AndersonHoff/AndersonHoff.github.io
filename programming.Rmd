<font size="3"> In my past research activities, I needet to use different programming languages, as C++, Fortran, GnuPlot, Shell, Python, R. In general, I only learned the sufficient to solve my research challenges at each particular moment. The main difference now is that I really enjoyed R, and I am going deeper in this field to use it as a work tool.  

Below there is a summary of my works, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndersonHoff).

[COVID-19](https://github.com/AndersonHoff/Covid19)  
My first Shiny App, where I plot the data and some analysis related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The app can be seen [here](https://anderson-hoff.shinyapps.io/Covid19/).  

[ChaoticTimeSerieswithR](https://github.com/AndersonHoff/ChaoticTimeSerieswithR)   
Routines which I developed during my postdoctoral research to identify chaotic behavior in experimental and simulated time series (still in development).  

[Upvotes analysis](https://github.com/AndersonHoff/Upvotes_analysis)  
Some data analysis and machine learning experiments to predict the number of upvotes for answers questions. The analysis is developed in RMarkdown, and can be seen [here](files/Upvotes.html).
